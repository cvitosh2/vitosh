&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jan Krtitel Vitous (John&nbsp; Baptist
Vitosh) was born on&nbsp; June 16, 1832 in the village of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Ajezd_u_Svat%C3%A9ho_K%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%BEe">Ujezd
u
Svateho Krize</a>, Bohemia.&nbsp; John was
the third of seven children born&nbsp; to Frantisek and Anna
(Autersky)
Vittaus, farmers in&nbsp; Ujezd u Svateho Krize.&nbsp; His grandparents
were Vaclav (Wenceslaus)&nbsp;and Kateriny (Kozeluhova) Vittaus (Witauss), peasants&nbsp; in Stupno.&nbsp;
This information was found &nbsp; in the parish register of births,
volume 11, page 379 of the Roman Catholic rectory in Radnice, Czech
Republic. &nbsp; A copy of the report written in the <a name="1"></a><a href="pilzen123.htm"> Czech language</a> and a <a name="2"></a><a href="translation.htm"> translated copy</a> of the report can be
viewed at their corresponding&nbsp; links.&nbsp; These records were
obtained from the State Regional Archives in Pilsen, Czech&nbsp;
Republic.&nbsp; Otto Vitous, a friend of mine living in Ostrava, Czech
Republic was kind enough to help me get the report and translate it to
English.&nbsp; The names above are the Czech spellings as found in the
Pilsen report. &nbsp; Note that the names recorded in the parish
register were not always spelled the same.&nbsp; It is my understanding
that the scribe or priest who recorded the names may have used
different spellings with time.&nbsp; Such spelling irregularities&nbsp;are common in old church records.</big></font></big></p>
<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big>
<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John Baptist Vitosh is
my great grandfather, who brought his family to America in 1867.&nbsp;
I am telling this story of his life, as best as I understand it, from
the records found in Pilsen,&nbsp;a personal visit to his birth home on
September 4, 2000 and many other records I have found on his life in
Iowa and Nebraska. &nbsp;I want to acknowledge and thank my sister
Bernice
Ruyle, for her work on the Vitosh genealogy.&nbsp; I am greatly
indebted to her for the many records she has kept over the last 50
years.<br>

<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big>
<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a name="3"></a><a href="krize13.htm"> John Vitosh's birth home, number 13</a>, is still
standing in the village of Ujezd u Svateho Krize.&nbsp; He grew up as a
farm boy in
the village of Ujezd u Svateho Krize.&nbsp; In his teen age years he
met Anna
Blecha, daughter of Vojtech and Anna (Razim) Blecha, peasants in
Krise.&nbsp; Krise is a small village located approximately 5 miles
southwest of Ujezd u Svateho Krize.&nbsp; He may have met Anna in the <a name="4"></a><a href="church.htm"> Stupno Roman Catholic church</a>.&nbsp;
The birth
records of&nbsp; John's younger brothers and sisters were found in the
Stupno parish register rather&nbsp; than Radnice.&nbsp; The
village of Stupno is located about 2 miles&nbsp; southeast of
Krise.&nbsp; The family must have moved to the&nbsp; Stupno area or
started attending the Stupno church soon after John was born.&nbsp;<a name="5"></a> <a href="krize-map.htm"> All of these villages</a> are
located within a few miles of each other and can be found approximately
10 miles northeast of Pilsen, Czech Republic.&nbsp; </big></font></big></p>
<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big>
<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John and Anna were
married&nbsp;in their early twenties. Their first child,
Katerina (Kate), was born on November 10,&nbsp; 1854.&nbsp; My
grandfather, Joseph was the sixth child to be born in Bohemia.&nbsp; He
was born on March 8, 1866&nbsp;<a name="6"></a> <a href="krise16.htm">in
house number 16&nbsp; in Krise</a>.&nbsp; The house still stands&nbsp;today in the small village of Krise.&nbsp; The children born in Bohemia
were, Katerina. Vaclav, Matej, Vojtech,&nbsp; Marie&nbsp; and
Josef.&nbsp; These are the Czech spellings for Kate, James, Michael,
Albert, Mary and Joseph as known in America.</big></font></big></p>
<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big>
<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a mystery as to
why John and Anna Vitosh decided to leave their homeland and
emigrate&nbsp; to&nbsp; America.&nbsp; They must have been faced with a
hard and oppressed&nbsp; life. &nbsp; Bohemia at that time was under
the rule of the Habsburgs, and was part of the Austrian Empire.&nbsp;
The foreign rule over the once independent&nbsp; Bohemian kingdom&nbsp;
was long resented and opposed by its inhabitants because it kept the
peasants in slavery and poverty without political or religious
freedom.&nbsp; In 1848, serfdom was abolished. &nbsp; This meant that
the aristocratic families no longer controlled all aspect of village
life. &nbsp; Marriages outside the parish&nbsp; were now
possible.&nbsp; Peasants could move to another village without a
special permit of the feudal nobility. &nbsp; Forced payments to the
landlords, church and school were also abolished and the peasants could
freely resettle&nbsp; or move.&nbsp; The farmers were set free, but
were required to buy the land&nbsp; from their noble lords. There were
constant wars and threats of war which&nbsp; added to the problems of a
poor economy and most young men were called to&nbsp; fight for the
Austrian Empire in far away lands and died in masses. &nbsp; In the
1866, war broke&nbsp; out between the Austrian Empire and Prussia.
&nbsp; Prussia defeated the Austrians in eastern Bohemia at Hradec
Kralove. &nbsp; Things did not look good for people in western
Bohemia.&nbsp; Under this difficult situation news of cheap land came
from America, the land of opportunity. &nbsp; The US needed farmers and
other experienced people to colonize
the rural&nbsp; states&nbsp; such as Iowa and Nebraska.&nbsp; A few
Bohemians started emigrating&nbsp; to the&nbsp; United States in the
1840's.&nbsp; Large numbers of Bohemians started&nbsp; arriving&nbsp;
in America in
the 1870's with emigration to the United States reaching&nbsp; a&nbsp;
peak in the 1890's.</big></font></big></p>
<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font><br><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1867 John Vitosh made
the decision to emigrate to the United States. &nbsp; It&nbsp; must
have been a hard decision to </big></font><font size="+1"><big>uproot his
family a</big></font><font size="+1"><big>nd to leave his six brothers and
sisters.&nbsp; Joseph, my grandfather, was only&nbsp; one year old when
they&nbsp;
decided to leave. &nbsp; I do not know how they got to Bremerhaven, a
German port city. &nbsp; I can only guess that they traveled by train.
&nbsp;The first train tracks in Bohemia were laid in about the
1840's.&nbsp;</big> </font><font size="+1"><big>How they were able
to finance the trip
to America, I do not know, but I suspect that they may have sold
most of their belongings including their house or were helped by other
members of the family.</big></font><br><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big> 


<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On June 9, 1867, the
family&nbsp; boarded the<a name="7"></a> <a href="weiland.htm"> German
Bark, Wieland</a>
for America.&nbsp; Documentation of their departure
was&nbsp; found&nbsp; on microfilm No 889442, ship No 41.&nbsp; This
Quebec Passenger List of 1867 was obtained from the Later Day Saints
Archives in Salt&nbsp; Lake City, Utah.&nbsp; On the microfilm
list, I found the name Joh Witousch, male&nbsp; 35, female 30, male
children 10, 8, 6, and 4, female child 12 and a one year old
infant.&nbsp; Joh was listed as a farmer&nbsp; from Bohemia.&nbsp; The
spelling here is German rather than Czech.&nbsp; Interesting enough,
the next name on the list is Jrg Blecha or George Blecha. This could
have been a brother of John's wife, Anna.&nbsp; I have no further
record of this&nbsp; individual.</big></font></big></p>
<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big>
<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The clue to finding
this passenger
list was found in the Johnson County Courthouse in Iowa City.
Iowa.&nbsp;
In the fall&nbsp; of 1999, I stopped in Iowa City to find John
Vitoush's
naturalization papers. &nbsp; There I found two documents, his<a name="8"></a> <a href="nat-int.htm"> Declaration of Intention to
become a citizen&nbsp; of the United States</a> and his <a name="9"></a><a href="nat-rec.htm"> Naturalization papers</a>.&nbsp; Reproductions
of&nbsp; these documents are found in the Appendix.&nbsp; Note&nbsp;
that the spelling of his last name at this time was Vitoush.&nbsp; In
the&nbsp; Declaration of Intent to become a citizen, he states that he
entered&nbsp; the United States through the Port of Chicago.&nbsp; In
order to do that,&nbsp; he would have been required to disembark in
Quebec, Canada and take a smaller&nbsp; boat to Chicago via the Great
Lakes.</big></font></big></p>
<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big>
<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know very little
about the
voyage from Germany to America, but I can only imagine from other
accounts that it must have been very uncomfortable and possibly a life
threatening trip especially with my grandfather who was one year
old.&nbsp; He must have been a strong and healthy baby.&nbsp; The trip
across the Atlantic could have taken 7-8 weeks.&nbsp; In my search for
a picture or description of the German Bark, Wieland, I was able to
obtain a reproduction of a painting and history of the ship from the
German Maritime Museum, Deutsches Schiffahrtsmuseum. </big></font></big></p>
<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big>
<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have no information
of their
trip from Chicago to Iowa, but at that time there were many Bohemian
emigrants
living in Chicago who could have helped them get to Iowa City.&nbsp;
The
Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad from Chicago to Iowa City was
in
service prior to 1867.&nbsp; The family may have taken the train to
Iowa City.&nbsp; In 1875, John Vitoush applied to become a citizen of
the United States.&nbsp; On January 16, 1878, he received his
Naturalization papers.&nbsp; This document also gave citizenship to his
wife and children.&nbsp; In the 1880 census, John Vittosh was living </big></font><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;">in

</span><font size="+1"><big> Johnson County.&nbsp; His occupation was
listed as a teamster.&nbsp; At this time there were only four children
living at this household (Anna, 11, Fannie, 9, Frank, 6 and William, 2
months).&nbsp; These were Joseph&#8217;s younger brother and sisters
born in
Iowa.&nbsp; None of the older children were living in this household in
1880.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time Joseph would have been 14 years old and
was probably living with his older brothers or sister.&nbsp;
Joseph&#8217;s
oldest brother James would have been 24, Michael 22, Albert 20 and Mary
18.&nbsp; Joseph&#8217;s oldest sister would have been about 26 but she
was
not married until 1887 in Beatrice, Nebraska. My speculation is that
these children were living and working on a farm.&nbsp; The Michael
Vitosh farm was located in Section 24 of Sharon Township, Johnson
County.&nbsp; The farm is now owned by Orval Grout (2005 Platt
map).&nbsp; This information was given to me by Paul Neuzil on a visit
to his farm in 2005.&nbsp; Michael was not married until 1882 but
perhaps they were living on this farm at the time.<br>
</big></font></big></p>
<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font><font size="+1"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1885, John and
several of
his children traveled to Odell, Nebraska.&nbsp; On June 10, 1885, the
Nebraska census lists John, Anna, Joseph, Frances and Frank as all
living in Gage County, Elm twonship, Nebraska.&nbsp; A picture of <a name="10"></a><a href="j&amp;av-pic.htm">John and Anna (Blecha) Vitosh</a>&nbsp;
was taken in Beatrice, Nebraska&nbsp; in the late 1880's by the
F. R. Chase Studios. &nbsp; On August
27, 1888, John Vitosh purchased 160 acres in the<a name="11"></a> <a href="elm-map.htm"> northeast corner of Section 26, Gage County</a>.&nbsp;
In 1901 this property&nbsp; was sold for $30 per acre to Albert Pribil
(Prybil) from Iowa City, who married&nbsp; his daughter Frances
(Fannie).&nbsp; In 1892, John Vitosh purchased 160 acres of land for
$15 in the southwest corner of Section 24, Gage
County.&nbsp;
Later this&nbsp; land was sold or deeded to his son,<a name="12"></a> <a href="jakostal.htm"> Joseph, who married Annie Kostal</a> February 29,
1892.&nbsp; Annie Kostal&#8217;s father, Albert came to Riverside, Iowa
in
1866
with the Shebek family from Sv. K&#345;í&#382;e, Bohemia.&nbsp;
This is the same village where John Vitosh was born.&nbsp; It is very
likely that the Vitosh and Shebek families knew each other in Bohemia
and in Iowa.&nbsp; Riverside, IA is located about 10 miles south
of Iowa City in Washington County.&nbsp; Albert Kostal married
Josephine
Shebek after they came to America.&nbsp; Nine children were born to
this family.&nbsp; Annie was born June 6, 1871 in Riverside,
Iowa.&nbsp; She was the second oldest child in the family.&nbsp; In
October of 1880 the Albert Kostal family moved to Odell, NE.&nbsp; They
traveled by covered wagon to their farm home, four miles south and a
half mile west of Odell (Source: Abbie McGinley).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph and Annie Vitosh lived on
the </big></font><font size="+1"><big><a href="javitosh_home.html">farm,
5
miles north of Odell and one mile west</a>.</big></font><font size="+1"><big>&nbsp; Seven children
were born to this couple.&nbsp; There were 5 boys; Rudolph, William,
Charles, Harry and Joseph Jr. and two girls; Mary and Clara.&nbsp;
Harry Joseph Vitosh, the fourth boy in the family is my father.&nbsp;</big></font><font size="+1"><big> Joseph and Frank&nbsp; were the only sons&nbsp; who came
to Nebraska and settled in Gage County.&nbsp; Nearly all of the
Vitosh's&nbsp;
living in the Odell area today are descendants of&nbsp;<a name="13"></a>
<a href="jovitoshfam.htm"> Joseph Vitosh</a>.&nbsp;
Several&nbsp; descendants of the&nbsp;<a name="14"></a><a href="frmavit.htm"> Frank Vitosh</a> family still live in the Odell
area, but only one with the name Vitosh.&nbsp;<a name="15"></a> <a href="katefam.htm">Kate
Vitosh</a> &nbsp; married Frank Bezdek of
Odell, but later moved of Ravenna, Nebraska. &nbsp; Frances Vitosh
Prybil died in 1909 and was buried in Iowa City.</big></font><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big>


<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John and Anna returned
to Iowa City around the turn of the century to be with their oldest
children, James, Michael and Mary.&nbsp; There are many descendants of
these three children who are still living in the Iowa City area.&nbsp;
I do not have records on all of these descendants.&nbsp; The 1900
census showed that John and Anna Vitoush were living at 828
Fairchild St., Iowa city. &nbsp; Anna Vitoush died at her
home on East Fairchild St., Iowa City on August 28, 1911. &nbsp;
John Vitoush died on January 2, 1912 at his home in Iowa City.&nbsp;
They are buried in the<a name="16"></a> <a href="jatomb.htm">St.
Joseph
Cemetery in Iowa City</a> along with&nbsp; three of their children
&nbsp; (Vojtech, Anna and Wilem).</big></font></big></p>
<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big>
<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is important to note
how the surname Vitosh has evolved with time.&nbsp; In the early 1800's
the&nbsp; Czech&nbsp; name was Vittaus, then Vitous.&nbsp; On the
passenger&nbsp; list you will find the German spelling Witousch.&nbsp;
In American I found&nbsp; it on the 1880 census as Vittosh and on the
1900 and 1910 census it was spelled Vitosh.&nbsp; On the naturalization
papers and&nbsp;obituary it was spelled Vitoush.&nbsp; On the <a name="17"></a><a href="jvdeath.htm">death certificate</a>&nbsp;and
the<a name="18"></a> <a href="jatomb.htm">tombstones</a> in Iowa City,
the name is spelled Vitosh.&nbsp; To my&nbsp; knowledge all descendants
of Jan Krtitel Vitous, who live in&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States, use
the name Vitosh.</big></font></big></p>
<big><font size="+1"><big> </big></font></big>
<p><big><font size="+1"><big> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is also interesting
to note
that there are several discrepancies in my great grandfather's age.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
His birth record from the <a name="19"></a><a href="translation.htm">
Pilsen Archives</a> puts his birthday as June 16, 1832.&nbsp; When he
boarded the German Bark Weiland on June 9, 1967, he would have
been&nbsp;
34 not&nbsp; 35 as he was listed on the passenger list, seven days
short of his&nbsp; 35th birthday.&nbsp; The June 1, 1880 census lists
him
as 50 years old.&nbsp; His correct age at that time should have been
47.&nbsp; On June 9, the 1900&nbsp; census lists his age as 67 which
is correct.&nbsp; I could not read the age&nbsp; on the 1910
census.&nbsp;
His <a name="20"></a><a href="jaobit.htm"> obituary</a> and <a href="jvdeath.htm"> death certificate</a> lists his age as 78 which I
believe to be incorrect due to the birth record found in the Pilsen
Archives.&nbsp; His correct age at his death should have been 79.&nbsp;
My interpretation of this is, that he had difficulty in determining his
age and may not have known his exact birth date. &nbsp; His son,
Michael, who signed his <a href="jvdeath.htm"> death certificate</a>,
did not know his exact birth date.</big></font></big></p><p style="text-align: center;"><big><big><b><a href="#0">TOP</a></b><br></big></big></p>
